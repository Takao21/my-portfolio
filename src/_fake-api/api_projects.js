      "This is one of my proudest projects in my early days of learning web. My father asked me about the Voucher printing apps going around in the local businesses. So, instead of buying those softwares, I wanted to try making one myself since I'm a proud programmer. Thus, using my knowledge of web programming, I created this Voucher Printing Webapp for my dad's shop. It's not an amazing project since it depends on Chrome to run but it will show my dedication and competitive mindset in technology. I felt good being able to help my dad using the technologies I've learnt.",
